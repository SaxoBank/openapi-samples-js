# Client-side Samples for corporate actions

## Event and Holdings
Corporate Actions are events initiated by companies who are issuers of securities. These events give opportunities to the owners of these securities to receive benefits or take part in certain activities.  Holdings are units of shares or other instruments of owners, which are usually the starting point of all the corporate actions.
These events could be
- Cash Dividend (DVCA): Distribution of cash to shareholders, in proportion to their equity holding. Ordinary dividends are recurring and regular. Shareholder must take cash and may be offered a choice of currency.

- Dividend Option (DVOP): Distribution of a dividend to shareholders with a choice of benefit to receive. Shareholders may choose to receive shares or cash. To be distinguished from DRIP as the company creates new share capital in exchange for the dividend rather than investing the dividend in the market.
Conversion (CONV): Conversion of securities (generally convertible bonds or preferred shares) into another form of securities (usually common shares) at a pre-stated price/ratio.
