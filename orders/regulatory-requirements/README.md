# Client-side Samples for Regulatory Requirements

This is a demonstration on the legal requirements for order tickets.

This example shows three important things which need to be in place for order tickets, to apply with the EU-MiFID regulations.

1. When the customer wants to trade a complex AssetType, the customer must be warned that specific knowledge about this AssetType is required.
2. The customer must have the option to examine a cost breakdown of the transaction and holding the asset for 1 year.
3. If there is documentation about the asset (PRIIPS / KIID), the customer must have the option to download this (testing only possible with Live token).
